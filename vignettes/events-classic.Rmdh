Originally RxODE supported compound event IDs; rxode2 still supports
these parameters, but it is often more useful to use the the normal
NONMEM dataset standard that is used by many modeling tools like
NONMEM, Monolix and nlmixr, described in the [rxode2 types](rxode2-event-types.html) article.

Classically, RxODE supported event coding in a single event id `evid` described in the following table.


| 100+ cmt | Infusion/Event Flag           | <99 Cmt  | SS flag & Turning of Compartment                          |
|----------|-------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 100+ cmt | 0 = bolus dose                | < 99 cmt | 1 = dose                                                  |
|          | 1 = infusion (rate)           |          | 10 = Steady state 1 (equivalent to SS=1) without alag()   |
|          | 2 = infusion (dur)            |          | 11 = Steady state 1 at dose time with alag (SS=1)         |
|          | 6 = turn off modeled duration |          | 12 = Steady state 1/2 at dose+ alag()                     |
|          | 7 = turn off modeled rate     |          | 20 = Steady state 2 (equivalent to SS=2)                  |
|          | 8 = turn on modeled duration  |          | 21 = Steady state 2 at dose time with alag (SS=2)         |
|          | 9 = turn on modeled rate      |          | 30 = Turn off a compartment (equivalent to -CMT w/EVID=2) |
|          | 4 = replace event             |          |                                                           |
|          | 5 = multiply event            |          |                                                           |

The classic EVID concatenate the numbers in the above table, so an
infusion would to compartment 1 would be `10101` and an infusion to compartment 199 would be `119901`.

EVID = 0 (observations), EVID=2 (other type event) and EVID=3 are all
supported.  Internally an EVID=9 is a non-observation event and makes
sure the system is initialized to zero; EVID=9 should not be manually
set. EVID 10-99 represents modeled time interventions, similar to
NONMEM's MTIME. This along with amount (amt) and time columns specify
the events in the ODE system.

For infusions specified with EVIDs > 100 the amt column represents the rate value.

For Infusion flags 1 and 2 `+amt` turn on the infusion to a specific
compartment `-amt` turn off the infusion to a specific
compartment. To specify a dose/duration you place the dosing records
at the time the duration starts or stops.

For modeled rate/duration infusion flags the on infusion flag must be followed by an off infusion record.

These number are concatenated together to form a full RxODE event ID, as shown in the following examples:

### Bolus Dose Examples

Event coding in `rxode2` is encoded in a single event number `evid`. For
compartments under 100, this is coded as:


- This event is `0` for observation events.
- For a specified compartment a bolus dose is defined as:
  - 100\*(Compartment Number) + 1
  - The dose is then captured in the `amt`
- For IV bolus doses the event is defined as:
   - 10000 + 100\*(Compartment Number) + 1
   - The infusion rate is captured in the `amt` column
   - The infusion is turned off by subtracting `amt` with the same
     `evid` at the stop of the infusion.
	 
	 
For compartments greater or equal to 100, the 100s place and above
digits are transferred to the 100,000th place digit. For doses to the
99th compartment the `evid` for a bolus dose would be `9901` and the
`evid` for an infusion would be `19901`.  For a bolus dose to the
`199`th compartment the `evid` for the bolus dose would be
`109901`. An infusion dosing record for the `199`th compartment would
be `119901`.
